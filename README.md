# Wild Barraca

A game for the 2021 Global Game Jam

You are a worker in a disco who is in charge of the lost and found department. You will have to give the correct objects to the correct animals. However, this animals are tipsy and will only give you a light description on who has lost the item.

# How to play

You must cycle between both, the animals who have found an object (left) and the animals who have lost one (right) (with keys: A,D,J and K). You have a locker where you can store up to two objects (with keys: W and S). First time you press W or S, you will store the object in that drawer, when you press a second time you will give the object to the animal in the right. The animal on the left will give you indications on who has lost the object using several symbols (like water and dangerous) and you will have to give this object to the animal on the right who matches the description. If this combination is correct, you will gain score points and reset the timer, on the other hand if its wrong you will loose score points. The game ends if the timer reaches zero.
